# Yandex.Music clients analysis

## Project description

Comparison of Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths:
- Moscow is a metropolis subject to the rigid rhythm of the working week;
- St.Petersburg is a city of unique culture, unlike Moscow.

Some myths reflect reality. Others are empty stereotypes. Business must distinguish the former from the latter in order to make rational decisions. Using real data from Yandex Music, you will test hypotheses and compare the behavior of users in the two capitals.

## Hypotheses
- User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg this manifests itself in different ways.
- On Monday morning, certain genres of music prevail in Moscow, while others prevail in St. Petersburg. This is true for Friday evening as well.
- Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow, they listen to pop music more often, in St. Petersburg - Russian rap.
