# Protection of clients personal data

## Project description

We need to protect the data of customers of the insurance company. 

Develop a data transformation method that makes it difficult to recover personal information from it. 

The quality of the machine learning models does not deteriorate during the transformation.

## Data
The dataset is insurance.csv file.

*Features:* gender, age and salary of the insured, the number of members of his family.

## Resume
- The proposed data conversion algorithm solves the problem of protecting user data.
- Encrypted data is fully suitable for predictions using linear regression.
- Due to the random choice of the matrix, it will be very difficult to restore personal information without the source code.

## Skills and tools 
- python
- pandas
- mathplotlib
- sklearn
- phik.report
- linear algebra
