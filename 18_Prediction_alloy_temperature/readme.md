# Prediction alloy temperature

## Main aims
Build a machine learning model to predict steel temperature. Achieve MAE below 6.8

## Resume
- EDA
- Following ML models (RidgeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, LightGBMRegressor, XGBRegressor) were evaluated.
- The neural network with three linear layers and ReLu activation function (loss function - MSELoss, optimiser - AdamW) was trained.

- python
- pandas, numpy
- sklearn
- sqlalchemy
- lightgbm
- xgboost
- optuna
